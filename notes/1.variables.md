# Variables

## Assignment

Variable declaration is done through the `let` keyword, value binding is done by means of the `=` sign.

All variables are `immutable` by default, if we want to mutate variables we have to add the `mut` keyword after `let` so `let mut a_number = 10` can be mutated while `let a_number = 10` can't.

````rust
// 5
let num = 5;
// Illegal we have to define this variable as mutable or reuse let
num = 10;

// legal cause of using let again
let num = 10;
````

We can also work around this by means of `variable shadowing`, while we can't reassign the value of a non `mut` variable we can redeclare by means of `let` this means that this code-block will work. This means that lexical scopes don't require unique variables, it can be used to create a new binding for a variable.

````rust
// 5
let shadow_num = 5;
// 10
let shadow_num = shadow_num + 5;
````

## Scopes

In Rust we also have a notion of scopes, shadowing a variable in a lower scope does not touch the assignment of the outer-scope, much like JS
so to say.

```rust
fn main() {
  let x = 5;

  let x = x + 1;

  {
    let x = x * 2;
    println!("The value of x in the inner scope is: {}", x); // 12
  }

  println!("The value of x is: {}", x); // 6
}

```
